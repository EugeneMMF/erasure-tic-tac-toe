            <h2>Operation</h2>
            <p>
                The game works such that each player can only have 3 plays currently active on the board. When they make their fourth play their first play is erased from the board.
                <br>
                The play to be erased will be have a red color (similar to that of the word Erasure in the game title).
                <br>
                There is a difficulty bar. This bar ranges from 1 to 7 with 1 being the easiest and 7 the hardest. The actual implementation is such that this value tells the computer how many plays ahead it should look.
                <br>
                When someone wins the win is marked out by a line.
                <br>
                To restart click on New Game. You then either select to Play as O or Play as X.
                <br>
                X always starts.
